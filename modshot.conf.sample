# About filesystem paths specified in this config:
# The "gameFolder" path is resolved either relative
# to the directory containing the Oneshot executable
# (the default behavior), or relative to the current
# working directory (when compiled with
# -DWORKDIR_CURRENT). All other paths are resolved
# relative to gameFolder and ignoring both RTPs and
# encrypted archives.

# Start the game in debug/developer mode
# (default: disabled)
#
# debugMode=false

# Continuously print average FPS to console.
# This setting does not affect the window title
# FPS display toggled via F2
# (default: disabled)
#
# printFPS=false

# Start game in fullscreen mode,
# i.e. Big Picture/console mode.
# (default: disabled)
#
# fullscreen=false

# as opposed to stretch-to-fill
# (default: enabled)

# Sync screen redraws to the monitor refresh rate
# (default: enabled)

# vsync=true

# Override the game window title
# (default: none)
#
# windowTitle=Custom Title

# Enforce a static frame rate
# (0 = disabled)
#
# fixedFramerate=0

# Skip (don't draw) frames when behind
# (default: enabled)
#
# frameSkip=true

# Use a fixed framerate that is approx. equal to the
# native screen refresh rate. This is different from
# "fixedFramerate" because the actual frame rate is
# reported back to the game, ensuring correct timers.
# If the screen refresh rate cannot be determined,
# this option is force-disabled
# (default: disabled)
#
# syncToRefreshrate=false

# Don't use alpha blending when rendering text
# (default: disabled)

# solidFonts=false

# Work around buggy graphics drivers which don't
# properly synchronize texture access, most
# apparent when text doesn't show up or the map
# tileset doesn't render at all
# (default: disabled)
#
# subImageFix=false

# Enable framebuffer blitting if the driver is
# capable of it. Some drivers carry buggy
# implementations of this functionality, so
# disabling it can be used as a workaround
# (default: enabled)
#
# enableBlitting=true

# Limit the maximum size (width, height) of
# most textures mkxp will create (exceptions are
# rendering backbuffers and similar).
# If set to 0, the hardware maximum is used.
# This is useful for recording traces that can
# be played back on machines with lower specs.
# (default: 0)
#
# maxTextureSize=0

# Set the base path of the game to '/path/to/game'
# (default: executable directory)

# Allow symlinks for game assets to be followed
# (default: disabled)
#
# allowSymlinks=false

# Set the game window icon to 'path/to/icon.png'
# (default: none)

# Define raw scripts to be executed before the
# actual Scripts.rxdata execution starts
# (default: none)
#
# preloadScript=my_win32_wrapper.rb
# preloadScript=ruby18_fixes.rb

# Index all accesible assets via their lower case path
# (emulates windows case insensitivity)
# (default: enabled)
#
# pathCache=true

# Font substitutions allow drop-in replacements of fonts
# to be used without changing the RGSS scripts,
# eg. providing 'Open Sans' when the game thinkgs it's
# using 'Arial'. Font family to be substituted and
# replacement family are separated by one sole '>'.
# Be careful not to include any spaces.
# This is not connected to the built-in font, which is
# always used when a non-existing font family is
# requested by RGSS.
# (default: none)
#
# fontSub=Arial>Open Sans
# fontSub=Times New Roman>Liberation Serif

# Because mkxp is usually distributed as a stand alone
# build, no predefined load paths are initialized
# ($:, $LOAD_PATH) in the MRI backend. With this option,
# they can be specified manually (eg. when using a system
# libruby.so). It is however recommended to statically
# link all required gems into libruby.so.
# (default: none)

# rubyLoadpath=/usr/lib64/ruby/
# rubyLoadpath=/usr/local/share/ruby/site_ruby

# Number of OpenAL sources to allocate for SE playback.
# If there are a lot of sounds playing at the same time
